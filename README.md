# TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using part of the [Seinfeld dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles#scripts.csv) of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

**Install** [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your machine. Detailed instructions:

## 2. Create and Activate the Environment

Please go though this [doc](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) before you creating an environment.
After that create a environment using following command

```
conda create --name deep-learning
```

Then activate the environment using following command

```
activate deep-learning
```

#### Git and version control
These instructions also assume you have `git` installed for working with Github from a terminal window, but if you do not, you can download that first with the command:
```
conda install git
```

**Now, you can create a local version of the project**

1. Clone the repository, and navigate to the downloaded folder. This may take a minute or two to clone due to the included image data.
```
git clone https://github.com/koushik-elite/TV-Script-Generation.git
cd TV-Script-Generation
```

2. Install PyTorch and torchvision; this should install the latest version of PyTorch.
	
	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch 
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```
	conda install pytorch -c pytorch
	pip install torchvision
	```

3. Install a few required pip packages, which are specified in the requirements text file (including OpenCV).
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or
```
conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```

4. That's it!, Now run the project using following command, check you default browser and open dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb file

```
jupyter notebook
```
